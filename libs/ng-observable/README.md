# NgObservable

Create powerful reactive components with Angular. AoT compatible and Ivy ready.

-   🚀 Observe lifecycle hooks such as `ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`
-   🎉 Convert `@HostListener` and template events into observable streams
-   ✈️ Manage and observe state changes in your components and directives
-   ☑️ Unlock blazing performance with zoneless, observable change detection
-   💥 Use `@Decorators` for all of the builtin lifecycle hooks
-   🍷 Derive computed values with the `@Computed` decorator
-   🚫 Escape async hell and redundant placeholder variables
-   🚮 Automatically clean up subscriptions with `Stream`
-   🎈 Get strongly typed changes with `TypedChanges<T>`
-   👉 Extract implementation details into pure reactive functions
